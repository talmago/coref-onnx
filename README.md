# spacy-coref

Lightweight, fast co-reference resolution using a distilled version of AllenNLP's coreference model (exported to ONNX). 

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† Cross-lingual coreference resolution
- ü™∂ Lightweight model based on AllenNLP‚Äôs coref modeling
- ‚ö°  Fast inference via ONNX
- üîå Easy integration with spaCy

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
$ pip install spacy-coref
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

Usage as a standalone component

```python
from spacy_coref import CoreferenceResolver, decode_clusters

resolver = CoreferenceResolver.from_pretrained("talmago/allennlp-coref-onnx-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-distilled-from-XLMR-Large")

sentences = [
    ["Barack", "Obama", "was", "the", "44th", "President", "of", "the", "United", "States", "."],
    ["He", "was", "born", "in", "Hawaii", "."]
]

pred = resolver(sentences)

print(decode_clusters(sentences, pred["clusters"][0]))

# Output is:
# [['Barack Obama', 'He']]
```

Usage with spaCy

```python
import spacy
import spacy_coref

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp.add_pipe("coref_minilm")

doc = nlp("Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. He was elected president in 2008.")
print(doc._.coref_clusters[0])
print(doc._.cluster_heads)
print(doc._.resolved_text)

# Output is:
# [Barack Obama, He]
# {'Barack Obama': Barack Obama}
# Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. Barack Obama was elected president in 2008.
```
